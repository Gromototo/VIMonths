## Roadmap

### Version 1.0

- [x] Develop a module to determine the grayscale scale (order of characters from darkest to lightest) based on the font and size used.

- [x] Create a conversion function capable of transforming RGB images into grayscale images.

- [x] Implement a function to generate an image using specific characters, similar to ASCII art, based only on the most appropriate range of grayscale characters.

- [x] Save the generated character grids.

### Version 1.0.1

- [x] Improving the character-brightness mapping is necessary due to the non-uniform distribution of characters in the grayscale.

- [x] Modify grayscale for white mode

### Version 1.1

- [x] Implement the DBScan algorithm to find predominant colors
- [x] To enhance the text image, a color palette of n colors can be added




### Version X.X.X
- [] Use a different method to find neigbor points in dbscan such as R-Tree or DK-Tree
